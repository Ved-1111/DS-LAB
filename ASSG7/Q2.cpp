// A slightly improved selection sort – We know that selection sort algorithm takes the minimum on
// every pass on the array, and place it at its correct position. The idea is to take also the maximum on
// every pass and place it at its correct position. So in every pass, we keep track of both maximum and
// minimum and array becomes sorted from both ends. Implement this logic.
